Welcome to my personal blog!

### What's Splitmind?

This is my space to aliviate when I'm overthinking too much, in my case many times I reduce ideas and opinions to dual or binary points, where both thoughts have the same importance (weight meaning) and I can't decide which idea is better or I stand with.
So split mind is a personal term when I'm in that situation.
