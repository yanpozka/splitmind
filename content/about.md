Welcome to my personal blog!

### What's Splitmind?
This is my space to aliviate when I'm overthinking too much (which happens a lot), many times we reduce ideas and opinions to a dual or binary point where both thoughts have the same importance, weight meaning and I can't decide which one is better or I stand with.
So split mind is a personal term when I'm in that situation.
